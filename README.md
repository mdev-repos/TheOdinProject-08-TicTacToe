# The Odin Project - Tic Tac Toe Game Project (8)

This is the second of twelve projects included in the JavaScript Course, fourth within the full-stack JS developer path. 
For this project, the creation of a tic tac toe game was requested, mainly to practice what we had learned about factory functions and the module pattern.
We initially worked on the game logic (pure JS), and then created the GUI, styling it and handling DOM events.

I hope you like my work :)
